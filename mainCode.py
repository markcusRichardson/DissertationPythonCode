# Smart Bike System â€“ Thread Manager (Main Execution File)
# -------------------------------------------------------
# This script launches the core background threads that run the smart bike system:
#    1. Serial communication thread (with two Arduinos for GPS, radar, etc.)
#    2. MQTT communication thread (to send/receive data to/from a mobile device)
#
# The threads are started as daemons so they run in the background and terminate when the main program exits.
